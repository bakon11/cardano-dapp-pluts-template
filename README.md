## Cardano Dapp Template

Building a truly decentralized application (DApp) can be daunting. While you can use wallet extensions and leverage CIP-30 for blockchain interactions, what happens if the wallet service or its infrastructure fails?

This template provides everything you need to create a Cardano DApp that doesn't rely on third-party services. It's designed to handle all wallet functions and connect to your infrastructure of choice, ensuring your DApp remains operational and independent.
